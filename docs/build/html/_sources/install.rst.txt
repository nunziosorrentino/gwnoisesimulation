Installation
***********************
The GW Sky Simulator is available under GNU License and is available at Gitlab.com.
The main page of the project can be found at the `the Gitlab repository <https://gitlab.com/mrazzano/gtskysim>`_.

In order to install the GW Sky Simulator, you have two solutions: you can install from the GIT repository or using PIP.

Installing with GIT
======================================

You can get the latest version of the pympsi package from `the GIT repository <https://gitlab.com/mrazzano/pympsi>`_.
You simply have to git clone the project with this command:

.. code-block:: console

 git clone https://gitlab.com/mrazzano/gtskysim.git

This will create a directory called gtskysim under your current directory. In this directory you will find the code needed to run the installer. If you use git you will get the latest version of the code

Installing with PIP
======================================

This will be implemented soon. Stay tuned!
