# Welcome to Nunziato Sorrentino Simulation PhD Project!

This is the part of my PhD Thesis voted to obtain simulated gravitational waves timeseries with close encounters signals injected. 
This work is a contribution to the a fast simulator specifically designed for gravitational wave physics, calles GWSkySim, 
done with the Prof. Massimiliano Razzano group at University of Pisa.
This features various kinds of gravitational wave sources and different response functions relative to the main
gravitational wave detectors, that can be used to carry on various projects that require detailed simulations
of gravitational wave source populations, including population studies and observational scenarios studies.
In this case the goal is obtaining a long timeseries containing low SNR signals from eccentric compact objects close encounters
and use them for training a CNN detection pipeline to distinguish them from the main transient noises that can mimic their presence.
